# Serverless Configuration

This document serves as a basic outline for configuring your Azure Function App through `serverless.yml`.

- `service` - Name of service. Used to generate name for resource group, function app, and other resources

## Provider Configuration

- `provider.name` - Name of serverless provider. Always `azure`
- `provider.os` - Operating system for function app. Available options:
    - `windows` (default)
    - `linux`
- `provider.runtime` - Runtime language for function app. Available options (no default, must be specified):
    - `nodejs10`
    - `nodejs12`
    - `python3.6` (forced to use `linux`)
    - `python3.7` (forced to use `linux`)
    - `python3.8` (forced to use `linux`)
- `provider.region` - [Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) for resources
- `provider.prefix` - Prefix used in naming convention for resources. Default `sls`
- `provider.subscriptionId` - Subscription ID to be used in deployment. Can also be set via:
   - Command-line argument (`--subscriptionId {SUB_ID}`)
   - Environment variable (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`)
- `provider.stage` - Stage for resources. Default `dev`
 <!-- TODO - provider.type -->
- `provider.environment` - Key value pairs to set as app settings (environment variables) within function app. Example:
    ```yaml
    provider:
      environment:
        VARIABLE_FOO: 'bar'
    ```
- `provider.apim` - APIM Configuration. See [documentation](../docs/examples/apim.md) for more details 

## Plugin Configuration

- `plugins` - List of plugins used by service. Must always include:
    `- serverless-azure-functions`

## Package Configuration

- `package.include` - Files or folders to include in package
- `package.exclude` - Files or folders to exclude from package

## Functions Configuration

Example:

```yaml
functions:
  hello:
    # Handler is in src/handlers/hello.js and function sayHello
    handler: src/handlers/hello.sayHello
    events:
      # Http Triggered function
      - http: true
        # Allows GET method
        methods:
          - GET
        authLevel: anonymous # can also be `function` or `admin`
```

## Full Example Config

```yaml
# Welcome to Serverless!
#
# This file is the main config file for your service.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# You can always add more config options for more control.
# We've included some commented out config examples here.
# Just uncomment any of them to get that config option.
#
# For full config options, check the docs:
#    docs.serverless.com
#
# Happy Coding!

service: my-api

# You can pin your service to only deploy with a specific Serverless version
# Check out our docs for more details
# frameworkVersion: "=X.X.X"

provider:
  name: azure

  # stage: dev
  # type: premium  # premium azure functions

  environment: # these will be created as application settings
    VARIABLE_FOO: 'foo'

  # you can define apim configuration here
  # apim:
  #   apis:
  #     - name: v1
